    <brief_summary>
        <textblock>
            Chronic liver diseases are common and the two main causes in France are NAFLD (No Alcoholic&#xD;
            Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic) and ALD (alcoholic liver disease).&#xD;
            &#xD;
            Because of the importance of the current global obesity, NAFLD has become very common and it&#xD;
            is estimated that its prevalence in the general population reaches 20-30%.&#xD;
            &#xD;
            NAFLD (No Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic) and ALD (alcoholic liver disease)&#xD;
            includes a broad spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis isolated&#xD;
            (infiltration of fat in the liver), in hepatic inflammation, fibrosis (abnormally high&#xD;
            accumulation of extracellular components in the functional liver tissue) and finally&#xD;
            cirrhosis and its complications.&#xD;
            &#xD;
            Choline deficiency (essential nutrient generally classified as Class B vitamins) has been&#xD;
            associated with liver damage each characterizing NAFLD and ALD. The amount of choline in the&#xD;
            body depends in particular on food intake and degradation of choline by the intestinal&#xD;
            microbiota.&#xD;
            &#xD;
            NAFLD and ALD are complex pathologies resulting from the interaction of environmental /&#xD;
            nutritional factors and a genetic background. It therefore appears now necessary to study the&#xD;
            influence of the relationship between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and gut&#xD;
            microbiota metabolism of choline on the severity of liver injury observed in NAFLD and ALD.&#xD;
            &#xD;
            If the interaction of these three elements (the host genetics - environmental factors - and&#xD;
            intestinal microbiota metabolic choline) has an influence on the severity of the lesions of&#xD;
            NAFLD and ALD direct application may be of bring a food supplement choline in patients at&#xD;
            risk (mutation of the PEMT gene (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase),&#xD;
            postmenopausal women, microbiota profile for increased degradation of dietary choline) to&#xD;
            restore the amount of choline in the body and thus to avoid a worsening of the ALD or NAFLD&#xD;
            and progression to cirrhosis.&#xD;
